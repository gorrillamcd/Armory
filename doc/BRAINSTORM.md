I figure this is as good a place as any to include some brainstorming for features/improvements to Armory:

### Version 1

* All v1 issues on github
* Cleanup look of UI (it's kinda plain right now)
* Basic refactoring, just enough to make it read nice and be production-worthy

### Version 2

* Generate pdf Syllabus for courses from database (that'd be an awesome feature!)
* Include basic student/teacher communication tools. More to come in the future, but it's a start.
