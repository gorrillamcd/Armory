It is written with Ruby on Rails and is currently still cooking in the oven. Don't worry, it'll be ready soon. If you'd like to contribute, check out the [source code](https://github.com/gorrillamcd/armory/).\r\n\r\n## Why Armory?\r\nAt the Bible College where I serve, we were wanting to make our classes available online for people to take. Plus, we were already feeling the hurt of not having a cohesive solution for managing students, teachers, etc. So we started looking at different solutions, but none seemed to fit. Either they were pricey with lots of features we didn't need or they were not high-quality and easily customizable.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end of 2011, we started building our own solution, and so Armory was born...\r\n\r\n### The Vision\r\nWe hope that Armory will be used to make life easier for Bible Colleges and other ministries that have need of this type of application. It will not only be for making courses available online, but also for local administration of a physical bible college. The goal is to create a versatile application to function both as a student management system and online learning platform that looks professional, is packed with only the features you need, and that can be operated by someone without programming knowlegde\r\n\r\n### Version 1\r\nVersion 1 is currently being worked on. It will provide the basic functionality necessary for an online school system (courses, secure login system, quizzes and exams, lessons, etc) but will be lacking in some handy features like communication with the teacher within the application, forums for discussion of the lessons, the ability to customize easily the look and branding and various admin features. That's where version 2 comes in! Version 1 is also very specific to [CCBC Mexico](http://ccbcmexico.com/). Version 2 will be more generalized and customizable.\r\n\r\n## Contributing to the Project\r\nAre you knowledgeable with web development? How about Ruby on Rails? Then you can help develop this project. Even if you aren't a programmer, you can help with testing or become a programmer ( [it's not as hard](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) [as you might think!](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) )\r\n\r\nContributing code is **easy**:\r\n\r\n* Fork the repository\r\n* Make the change you want to incorporate\r\n* Make a pull request\r\n* It will then be incorporated or not\r\n\r\nAlso, if you find a bug, but don't know/don't have time to make the change yourself, post an issue on the issues page.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to try out the application**, but don't have a development environment setup? Check the wiki for a tutorial of how to setup the dev environment (even for windows newbies!).","name":"Armory"}
